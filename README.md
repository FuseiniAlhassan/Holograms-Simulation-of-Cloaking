# Introduction
Optical concealment and wavefront reconstruction are central challenges in modern photonics, with applications ranging from stealth technology and biomedical imaging to augmented reality and optical encryption. While geometric optics and wave optics offer distinct frameworks for manipulating light, their integration into unified simulation environments remains rare in educational and exploratory contexts. This project addresses that gap by presenting a dual-module computational platform that models two foundational phenomena: ray cloaking and digital holography.
The first module explores refractive cloaking through ray tracing, simulating how parallel light rays bend around a circular cloaked region. By leveraging spatial geometry and Snellâ€™s law, the simulation demonstrates how carefully engineered refractive index profiles can redirect optical paths to conceal objects from view. This geometric approach provides intuitive insight into the principles of invisibility and optical redirection, echoing concepts found in transformation optics and metamaterial design.
The second module shifts to a wave-based perspective, simulating the formation and reconstruction of a digital hologram. A circular object interacts with a reference wave to produce an interference pattern, which is captured as a hologram. Using Fourier-based reconstruction techniques, the original object is computationally recovered, illustrating key principles of interference, diffraction, and inverse imaging. This module introduces students and researchers to the fundamentals of holography and the mathematical tools required for wavefront analysis.
Together, these modules form a cohesive framework for visualizing and understanding both geometric and wave-based approaches to optical manipulation. The ray tracing module emphasizes spatial intuition and refractive control, while the holography module highlights the power of frequency-domain analysis and computational recovery. Animated visualizations further enhance interpretability, making the simulations accessible for both instructional use and research prototyping.
By bridging ray optics and wave optics in a single interactive environment, it offers a compelling platform for exploring the physics of light and the algorithms that reveal its hidden structure.

ðŸ“„ Abstract
This project presents a dual-module simulation that explores two foundational concepts in computational optics: ray cloaking and digital holography. The first module models the behavior of parallel light rays as they bend around a circular cloaked region, demonstrating how spatial geometry and refractive principles can redirect optical paths to conceal objects. The second module simulates the formation and reconstruction of a digital hologram, where a circular object interferes with a reference wave to produce an intensity pattern from which the object can be computationally recovered using Fourier techniques.
Together, these simulations offer a unified framework for visualizing both geometric and wave-based approaches to optical concealment and recovery. The ray tracing module provides intuitive insight into refractive cloaking, while the holography module introduces core principles of interference, diffraction, and inverse reconstruction. An animated ray visualization further enhances interpretability. This project reflects a strong foundation in numerical modeling, wavefront analysis, and scientific visualization skills essential for graduate-level research in photonics, holography, and computational imaging.
